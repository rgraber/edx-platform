# Usage:
#   In an LMS-enabled container,
#   from the directory /edx/app/edxapp/edx-platform, run:
#     ./scripts/provision-demo-users.sh
#
# This file is an experimental re-implementation of demo user provisioning
# process defined in this Ansible role:
# https://github.com/edx/configuration/tree/master/playbooks/roles/demo
#
# It provisions five users:
#  * edx (global superuser)
#  * staff (global staff)
#  * verified
#  * audit
#  * honor
# Each of which has {username}@example.com as their email and 'edx' as their password.
#
# It was written as part of the effort to move our dev tools off of Ansible and
# Paver, described here: https://github.com/edx/devstack/pull/866
# TODO: If the effort described above is abandoned, then this script should
# probably be deleted.
