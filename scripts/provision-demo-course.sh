# This file is an experimental re-implementation of demo course provisioning

# It was written as part of the effort to move our dev tools off of Ansible and
# Paver, described here: https://github.com/edx/devstack/pull/866
# TODO: If the effort described above is abandoned, then this script should
# probably be deleted.
